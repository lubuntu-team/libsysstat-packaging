# libsysstat

## Overview

libsysstat is a library to query system information like CPU and memory usage or network traffic. Conceptually it's roughly similar to [libstatgrab](https://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab), a third-party library used by LXQt as well.   

It is maintained by the LXQt project but can be used independently from this desktop environment, too. As for LXQt libsysstat is used by plugin-sysstat of lxqt-panel and hence an optional dependency of the latter.   

Note replacing both libsysstat and libstatgrab in LXQt by KDE Frameworks components is being considered but a final decision hasn't been made yet, see https://github.com/lxde/lxqt/issues/704.

## Installation

### Sources

The only runtime dependency is qtbase. To build CMake is needed in addition, as well as optionally Git to pull latest VCS checkouts.

Code configuration is handled by CMake. CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` will normally have to be set to `/usr`, depending on the way library paths are dealt with on 64bit systems variables like `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` may have to be set as well.

To build run `make`, to install `make install` which accepts variable `DESTDIR` as usual.   

### Binary packages

The library is provided by all major Linux distributions like Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora and openSUSE.   
Just use the distributions' package managers to search for string `libsysstat`.
